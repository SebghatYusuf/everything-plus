3. **Reduce maximum results** if searches are slow
4. **Close other disk-intensive applications** during initial indexing

### Common Issues

#### Slow Search Results
- Check if indexing is still in progress
- Reduce the number of indexed locations
- Exclude large, unnecessary directories

#### High CPU/Memory Usage
- Usually occurs during initial indexing
- Check indexing progress in system tray tooltip
- Consider excluding system directories

#### Files Not Appearing in Results
- Ensure the file location is in indexed paths
- Check if file is hidden (enable "Include hidden files")
- Wait for real-time indexing to catch up (usually <1 second)

#### Application Won't Start
- Ensure Everything application is installed and running
- Check Windows Defender or antivirus exclusions
- Try running as administrator

### Database Maintenance

The application automatically maintains its database, but you can:

1. **Clear Index** - Settings ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí Clear Index
   - Removes all indexed data
   - Next launch will re-index everything

2. **Database Location** - `%APPDATA%\EverythingClone\data\everything_clone.db`
   - Backup this file to preserve your index
   - Delete to reset application

## Advanced Usage

### Power User Tips

1. **Bookmark Frequent Searches** - Use browser bookmarks for common filters
2. **Combine Filters** - Mix file types, sizes, and dates for precise results  
3. **Use Regex** - Learn basic regex for powerful pattern matching
